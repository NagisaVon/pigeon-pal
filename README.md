### You can feed it, interact with it, and there are many hidden Easter eggs to encourage users to explore.

We were inspired by virtual desktop pets and wanted to build our own cute pigeon pal desktop friend straight from Morningside Heights.


Built it in Python using tkinter with custom made gif animations.

## Try it yourself! Clone the repository and run the corresponding Python script.


Run the pet_for_mac.py file if you're on a MacOS system, and run pet_for_windows.py for Windows.

The Mac version runs with a border and background due to MacOS settings that we couldn't change :(

Run it in Windows for best effect :)
