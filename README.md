# Pigeon Pal
*Fab is here to help you become your best self.*

**For ADI DevFest2024!!**

## Pigeon Pal: A desktop pet that frolics around on your desktop. You can feed it, interact with it, there are many hidden Easter eggs to encourage users to explore.


We were inspired by virtual desktop pets and wanted to build our own cute pigeon pal desktop friend straight from Morningside Heights.


Built it in Python using tkinter with custom made gif animations.
